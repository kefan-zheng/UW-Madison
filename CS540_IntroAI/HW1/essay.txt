1 Predictions about the Next Big Advancement in AI
The advent of ChatGPT marks the popularization of AI, offering us a glimpse into its immense potential. However, even powerful LLMs like GPT-4 still face challenges, including misinformation, bias, and non-transparent decision-making[1]. Based on these issues, I think AI will achieve breakthroughs, particularly in the interpretability of AI.

1.1 Existing Issues of AI Interpretability
Primarily, the decision-making transparency and interpretability of AI models are significant concerns. Most current AI models are black box systems, and people do not know how AI makes decisions when faced with complex problems. It imposes constraints on the deployment of AI in some scenarios, such as healthcare, because it is difficult for people to believe AI diagnosis without clarifying AI's decision-making mechanism[2].

1.2 Development Status of AI Interpretability
Hence, a lot of research focuses on understanding how AI makes decisions. For example, exBERT is a visual analysis tool to explain the Transformer model[3]. It can dynamically display the reasoning process inside the model interactively and help researchers understand the working mechanism of the model. Besides visual explanation methods, other model-explanation technologies like proxy models are also under intense research[4]. In addition, Google Scholar reveals that the number of relevant papers on explainable AI is rising annually. The number of relevant papers in 2022 is roughly equal to the combined total in 2020 and 2021. Therefore, it is credible that there will soon be a breakthrough in model interpretability.

1.3 Potential Impact of AI Interpretability
As a result, once the mechanism of AI decision-making can be understood, the direct impact is that AI can not only be applied in some scenarios that require clear reasoning chains such as healthcare and research but also improve the model performance by analyzing decision deviations. In medical diagnosis, related research such as computer vision-based image diagnosis has been relatively mature. AI also holds substantial value in biopharmaceuticals and materials development. Thus, the interpretability of AI will significantly enhance model performance, leading to rapid implementation in healthcare, scientific research, and other scenarios, generating significant social value.

2 Social Impact of LLMs
Since the inception of ChatGPT, LLMs have penetrated various aspects of people's lives, emerging as a more efficient way to obtain knowledge, create content, and analyze documents. Personally, I believe LLM is beneficial to society if it is used correctly. Just like the Internet, AI is a tool that has greatly improved the efficiency of human life and work. Today, the capabilities of LLMs support countless intelligent applications, like the search engine Bing and the programming tool Copilot-X. However, LLMs also pose security risks as users can intentionally manipulate inputs, potentially leading to generations of illegal content. Therefore, the supervision of LLMs is indispensable.

3 Prospects for Humanity's Acceptance of AI Progress
I am optimistic regarding the acceptance of the AI advancements I predict within human society. For scientists, this helps them delve into AI and explore more potential of AI. For the general public, this can help everyone enjoy AI services with greater convenience, efficiency, and higher quality. For enterprises, this can also promote the implementation of academic research into industrial products, achieve growth in commercial value, and promote enterprise development. However, it is undeniable that some technical workers may lose their jobs because the skills they rely on to survive are replaced by AI. This is something many people do not want to see. Therefore, the future relationship between humans and AI is also a topic that needs to be studied.
